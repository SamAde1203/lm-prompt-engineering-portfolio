 👨‍💻 Technical Profile

AI Product Developer with an MSc in Software Engineering (Distinction) and 5+ years of experience specializing in the design, training, and deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) applications. I engineer reliable, multi-step prompt systems that transform complex user intent into high-quality, structured outputs for commercial use.

Core Competencies: Prompt Engineering & Chain-of-Thought Design • LLM Output Evaluation & Optimization • AI Product Development • RAG & Agentic Workflow Design • Commercial SaaS Deployment

Technical Stack: OpenAI GPT-4/3.5 API, Custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini • Python (API Integration, Automation) • Prompt Versioning (Git) • Structured Outputs (JSON, Markdown) • SEO/SERP Analysis Tools



 🚀 Featured Projects: Commercial AI Products

 [SaaSy Scribe ELITE](https://saasyscribepro.com) | Production Content Engine
   Role: Sole Developer & Prompt Architect
   Description: A commercial GPT ($197/month subscription) that autonomously generates 3,000-4,000 word, SEO-optimized long-form articles. The system replaces a full content workflow.
   Technical Implementation:
       Engineered a multi-stage prompt architecture handling keyword strategy, outline generation, section drafting, fact integration, and meta-creation.
       Designed for structured, consistent outputs to ensure publish-ready quality.
       Integrated SERP analysis and E-E-A-T framing directly into the prompt chain.
   Results: 92% user satisfaction, top-3 Google rankings for client content, 85% reduction in content production time.

 ResearchWriter Pro 4000 | Academic Drafting Engine
   Role: Developer & Reasoning Specialist
   Description: An AI system that produces 3,500-4,000 word academic research drafts with proper citations and critical analysis.
   Technical Implementation:
       Built complex multi-turn conversation designs to manage research depth and citation tracking.
       Implemented validation steps to reduce hallucination and improve factual accuracy to 89%.
       Structured prompts to enforce academic tone, logical flow, and argument coherence.
   Results: Reduced research drafting time from 8+ hours to ~45 minutes.

 🛠️ Technical Methodology & Artifacts

 1. Prompt Architecture & Design
My approach moves beyond single prompts to build robust reasoning chains.
- User-Intent Modeling: Crafting realistic scenarios and constraints that reflect true user goals.
- Multi-Step Decomposition: Breaking complex tasks into sequential LLM operations (Analyze → Plan → Draft → Validate).
- Structured Output Control: Using JSON schemas and markdown formatting to guarantee consistent, parsable results.
- Example: [View a prompt chain for competitive analysis](./prompt-architecture/competitive-analysis-prompt.md)

 2. LLM Evaluation & Optimization
I treat LLM output as a software artifact requiring rigorous QA.
- Quantitative Rubrics: Developed 5-point scales for Coherence, Relevance, Factual Accuracy, and Usability.
- Hallucination Mitigation: Implemented checkpoints for claim verification and source grounding.
- Iterative A/B Testing: Systematically testing prompt variations to optimize for target metrics (e.g., user satisfaction, accuracy).
- Example: [Download my output evaluation rubric](./evaluation-frameworks/output-evaluation-rubric.md)

 3. System Design & Deployment
- Product Thinking: Building AI tools with clear user journeys, onboarding, and value delivery.
- Commercialization: Experience taking AI prototypes to paid subscription models.
- Analytics: Tracking key performance indicators (user sat, task completion, accuracy) to guide iteration.



 📈 Impact & Metrics
- 92% User Satisfaction across deployed GPT products.
- 89%+ Task Accuracy on complex, multi-step generation tasks (academic writing, strategic content).
- 185% Improvement in content engagement (time-on-page) through optimized clarity and structure.
- 3 Commercial AI Products built, launched, and generating revenue.
- 320+ Long-Form Articles evaluated and optimized, creating a deep corpus for understanding quality signals.
