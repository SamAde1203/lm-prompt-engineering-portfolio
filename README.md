 👨‍💻 Technical Profile

AI Product Developer with an MSc in Software Engineering (Distinction) and 5+ years of experience specializing in the design, training, and deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) applications. I engineer reliable, multi-step prompt systems that transform complex user intent into high-quality, structured outputs for commercial use.

Core Competencies: Prompt Engineering & Chain-of-Thought Design • LLM Output Evaluation & Optimization • AI Product Development • RAG & Agentic Workflow Design • Commercial SaaS Deployment

Technical Stack: OpenAI GPT-4/3.5 API, Custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini • Python (API Integration, Automation) • Prompt Versioning (Git) • Structured Outputs (JSON, Markdown) • SEO/SERP Analysis Tools



 🚀 Featured Projects: Commercial AI Products

 [SaaSy Scribe ELITE](https://saasyscribepro.com) | Production Content Engine
   Role: Sole Developer & Prompt Architect
   Description: A commercial GPT ($197/month subscription) that autonomously generates 3,000-4,000 word, SEO-optimized long-form articles. The system replaces a full content workflow.
   Technical Implementation:
       Engineered a multi-stage prompt architecture handling keyword strategy, outline generation, section drafting, fact integration, and meta-creation.
       Designed for structured, consistent outputs to ensure publish-ready quality.
       Integrated SERP analysis and E-E-A-T framing directly into the prompt chain.
   Results: 92% user satisfaction, top-3 Google rankings for client content, 85% reduction in content production time.

 ResearchWriter Pro 4000 | Academic Drafting Engine
   Role: Developer & Reasoning Specialist
   Description: An AI system that produces 3,500-4,000 word academic research drafts with proper citations and critical analysis.
   Technical Implementation:
       Built complex multi-turn conversation designs to manage research depth and citation tracking.
       Implemented validation steps to reduce hallucination and improve factual accuracy to 89%.
       Structured prompts to enforce academic tone, logical flow, and argument coherence.
   Results: Reduced research drafting time from 8+ hours to ~45 minutes.

 🛠️ Technical Methodology & Artifacts

 1. Prompt Architecture & Design
My approach moves beyond single prompts to build robust reasoning chains.
- User-Intent Modeling: Crafting realistic scenarios and constraints that reflect true user goals.
- Multi-Step Decomposition: Breaking complex tasks into sequential LLM operations (Analyze → Plan → Draft → Validate).
- Structured Output Control: Using JSON schemas and markdown formatting to guarantee consistent, parsable results.
- Examples:
     [SaaSy Scribe Workflow](./prompt-architecture/saasy-scribe-workflow.md) - Multi-stage content generation
     [Research Paper Generator](./prompt-architecture/research-paper-generator.md) - Academic drafting system
     [Competitive Analysis Template](./prompt-architecture/competitive-analysis-prompt.md) - B2B strategy prompts

 2. LLM Evaluation & Optimization
I treat LLM output as a software artifact requiring rigorous QA.
- Quantitative Rubrics: Developed 5-point scales for Coherence, Relevance, Factual Accuracy, and Usability.
- Hallucination Mitigation: Implemented checkpoints for claim verification and source grounding.
- Iterative A/B Testing: Systematically testing prompt variations to optimize for target metrics.
- Frameworks:
     [Output Evaluation Rubric](./evaluation-frameworks/output-evaluation-rubric.md) - 5-point scoring system
     [Hallucination Detection Checklist](./evaluation-frameworks/hallucination-detection-checklist.md) - Fact verification protocol
     [Reasoning Chain Audit](./evaluation-frameworks/reasoning-chain-audit.md) - Logical coherence analysis

 3. System Design & Deployment
- Product Thinking: Building AI tools with clear user journeys, onboarding, and value delivery.
- Commercialization: Experience taking AI prototypes to paid subscription models.
- Analytics: Tracking key performance indicators (user satisfaction, task completion, accuracy) to guide iteration.
- Documentation:
     [Commercial GPTs Analysis](./projects/commercial-gpts.md) - Technical implementation details
     [SEO Playbook](./projects/seo-playbook.md) - Domain expertise demonstration
