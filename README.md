 💡 Prompt Engineering Methodology

 My Approach to LLM Training:
1. User-Intent Modeling - Create realistic scenarios that match actual user needs
2. Structured Reasoning - Build multi-step chains-of-thought for complex tasks
3. Output Validation - Implement fact-checking and consistency analysis
4. Iterative Refinement - A/B test prompts and optimize based on metrics
5. Edge Case Testing - Red-team for hallucinations, bias, and logic errors

 Key Metrics I Track:
- Output coherence & relevance scores
- Hallucination detection rates
- User satisfaction (4.6/5 avg across products)
- Task completion accuracy (89%+ on complex tasks)
- Response quality consistency
